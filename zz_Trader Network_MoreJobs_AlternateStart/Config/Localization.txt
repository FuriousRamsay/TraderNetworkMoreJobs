tutorialTipQuest01,Journal Tip,,"You head hurts so bad. You thought you were safe but they caught you by surprise while you were sleeping. You grabbed whatever was close and fought them off as best you could, but you had to run. You don't even have clothes on you.\n\nThey should be far enough away for you to pause. You're hurt and really need to treat whatever injuries you can before they get worse.\n\nIt's just a matter of time before they find you again.\n\nThey won't leave you alone, and this time you're ready to stand and fight."

At this point you need all the help you can get."
