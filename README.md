# Trader Network: More Jobs
This is a modlet to add additional Jobs/Challenges at the Traders

Can be installed for single player local games or server-side only when hosting a multiplayer server.

Currently tested with:
﻿	- Vanilla 19.5
	- Vanilla 19.4 B7
	﻿- Undead Legacy
	﻿- Darkness Falls
	- Sorcery

The following can be found as part of the Trader's job listing:

	Hold and Fetch (Tiers 1 through 5):
	- Phase 1: You are sent to a random POI which you have to clear
	- Phase 2: Once cleared, waves of zombies will spawn and you must kill a number of them in order to activate each subsequent wave
	- Phase 3: Fetch the Courier Satchel within the POI
	- Phase 4: A large number of zombies will spawn and you can either stay and fight or run back to the trader like a little baby
	- Phase 5: Get your reward from the trader you received the mission from
	﻿Note: you do not have to stay within the limits of the POI

	Protect (Tiers 1 through 5):
	You are sent to a random POI which you have to protect with the help of the locals (in white).
	- Tier 1: The Black Shield faction sends in some of their bandits (in red).
	- Tier 2: The Black Shield faction sends in more of their bandits.
	- Tier 3: The Black Shield faction experimented on some of their people and are sending them in along with their bandits.
	- Tier 4: The Black Shield faction pushed their experiments even further. Expect stronger and faster mutated bandits.
	- Tier 5: The Black Shield faction created a beserker mutation. Party up if you can.
﻿	Notes:
	  ﻿﻿- you can loot the bandits (extra dukes, even when alive)
	  ﻿﻿- you can loot the captains (even when alive) and they have a chance of dropping extra loot when they die
	﻿﻿  - you do not have to stay within the limits of the POI

The following can be purchased from the player vending machines at each trader. Each Tier increases in difficulty:

	POI Reset - Experimental:
	- A note that can be used when standing close to a POI in order to reset it entirely.
	- This can be useful when in need of specific resources (schematics, cement, cobblestone, etc)
	Notes: A questable POI is one that the trader will select as a possible location for a quest.
	       This item can rarely be found in the player vending machine or be potentially obtained by looting the corpse of one of the Black Shield Titans.

	Black Shield Titans (Tiers 1 through 5) - Experimental:
	You are sent to a random location where you have to fight one of the 5 Black Shield Titans with special abilities. Party up if possible.
	- Tier 1: The Bully: doesn't have much in terms of armor. Watch out for the occasional knockdowns.
	- Tier 2: The Giant: has leather armor which you can loot after the fight. It can shoot multiple arrows, make sure to dodge them.
	- Tier 3: The Mammoth: has scrap armor which you can loot after the fight. It will shoot electrical darts, make sure to dodge them. It also has the ability to knock you down at a certain distance and shock you.
	- Tier 4: The Goliath: has iron armor  which you can loot after the fight. It will breathe fire. It also has the ability to knock you down at a certain distance and burn you.
	- Tier 5: The Colossus: has steel armor  which you can loot after the fight. It will fire rockets, make sure to dodge them. It also has the ability to knock you down at a certain distance and cause explosive damage.
	Notes: This challenge yields the possibility of receiving the POI Reset note as a loot item. The higher the tier, the higher the probability of finding it.

	Ghosts (Parts 1 through 5) - Experimental:
	- Through each part you get to unveil a storyline involving the Trader Network and one of its enemy factions, the Black Shield
	- In parts 1 though 3, you are asked to track down and kill a series of cloaked mechanical prototypes that have mysteriously "escaped" from the Trader 
	﻿  Network's labs
	- Parts 4 and 5 become more difficult as the Black Shield unleashes new types of mechanical prototypes
	﻿- In part 5, you fight alongside the Trader Network's new line of white prototypes to defeat the Black Shield's robots and their plan to kill the 
	﻿  entire colony
	Note: Spawns occur over time and are essentially queued. You should do your best to stay and fight. If you leave and are in single player, the
	﻿      game will not clear the spawn queue (bug that has been submitted) which will cause NullException errors when you go back in. The spawns
	      will not occur, but the game will still attempt to action the queue until the queue is empty. Spawning usually lasts 6 minutes total. One way to
	      clear the queue is to close the game

	The Hunt (Tiers 1 through 5):
	- Clear a number of mutant animals (current Vanilla set of animals with different skins and will retaliate)
	- Each wave is triggered by killing a number of them
	- The Trader Network supplies you with mechanical allies to assist you in your mission
		- Tier 1: dogs that will regenerate your stamina if you stay close
		- Tier 2: wolves that will regenerate your health if you stay close
		- Tier 3: lions that will burn nearby zombies and knockback foes in an area of effect
		- Tier 4: bears that will do explosive damage to nearby foes which will knock them down
		- Tier 5: androids that will shock nearby foes
	- Allies will only have enough power for a few minutes
	- Get your reward from any trader once the objectives have been met

	﻿Mini Horde (Tiers 1 through 5):
	- Phase 1: You are sent to a random location to activate your mission. It is recommended that you build some sort of defenses
	- Phase 2: Waves of zombies will spawn and you must kill a number of them in order to activate each subsequent wave
	- Phase 3: A large number of zombies will spawn and you can either stay and fight or run back to the trader like a little baby
	- Phase 4: Get you reward from any trader once the objectives have been met

﻿	Horde Training (Tiers 1 through 5):
	- You are given a challenge that can be activated at any location. The idea is to test out your horde base against waves of zombies, see how
	﻿  well it holds
	- Zombies will spawn over time, there are no special activations required for them to continue spawning
	- There are no rewards for this challenge. It is purely meant to assist in you testing out your defenses or offensive abilities (should you wish to
	﻿  try this out in the open)
	Note: 	Spawns occur over time and are essentially queued. You should do your best to stay and fight. If you leave and are in single player, the
﻿        	game will not clear the spawn queue (bug that has been submitted) which will cause NullException errors when you go back in. The spawns
		will not occur, but the game will still attempt to action the queue until the queue is empty. Spawning usually lasts 6 minutes total. One way to
		clear the queue is to close the game
	        Not much testing has been done in multiplayer. Feedback is welcome

﻿	Mechanical Allies (Tiers 1 through 5):
	- The following allies can be purchased and spawned:
		- Tier 1: dogs that will regenerate your stamina if you stay close
		- Tier 2: wolves that will regenerate your health if you stay close
		- Tier 3: lions that will burn nearby zombies and knockback foes in an area of effect
		- Tier 4: bears that will do explosive damage to nearby foes which will knock them down
		- Tier 5: androids that will shock nearby foes
	Note: There are two types:
		- a crate which can only be used in Single Player mode. They will not work in Multiplayer (game code limitations)
		- a dispatcher which will work in both modes but cannot be accurately spawned like the crate. A green marker will show on your compass to
		﻿﻿  indicate where the ally has spawned

	﻿Note: These are prototypes and aren't very optimized. They rely on the core game AI which still has to be improved.
	﻿﻿- Ally Function 1: attack nearby zombies and hostile animals
	﻿﻿- Ally Function 2: follow player up to a certain point
	﻿﻿The AI does not do very well inside a POI, but crates can be placed in single player as way to help defend in certain situation should you need
	﻿﻿some assistance

Installation Instructions:

﻿	Multiplayer Server Install:
	Copy the zz_Trader Network_MoreJobs folder into the \Mods folder of your 7DTD server folder
	Note: 	all FuriousRamsaySpawnAllyNPCTierX lines in traders.xml should be commented out as these only work in single player

	﻿Single Player Local Installs:
	Copy the zz_Trader Network_MoreJobs folder into the \Mods folder of your 7DTD game folder
	﻿﻿Note: 	all qc_FuriousRamsaySpawnAllyNPCTierX (random spawns) lines in traders.xml should be commented out as these items
	        ﻿﻿﻿aren't as good as FuriousRamsaySpawnAllyNPCTierX ones (placeable spawns)
		Yellow warnings on the console can be ignored. Some references were added in order to support how Darkness Falls splits
		the trader's inventories. They have no impact on the game when not found.

﻿If you connect to servers who run this modlet, you do not have to do anything as this mod is server-side and will be loaded when you connect

Warning: Please back up your saved world and character before installing this mod. The game does not handle the removal of accepted or completed
	 quests well and will reset your character should you decide to remove the mod after trying it out. This is unfortunately a known issue 
	 with how the game is currently designed and out of modder's control. Other issues could include spamming of NullExceptionErrors which would
	 require you to use your backed up copy.One option is to leave the mod in and simply not make use of the additional challenges at the vending
	 machines (which are pretty useless otherwise anyway). If you decide to not use the mod and wish to no longer have any references to the new
	 jobs from the trader list, you can remove the following code from quests.xml:

	<append xpath="/quests/quest_list[@id='trader_quests']">
