TODO: mod to replace POI groups (by tier?)

Once all new entities are done:
TODO: Modify screamer groups with entities (no UMA)

TODO: Farming Trader quests
TODO: Handyman Trader quests

TRIED: Mechanical Vulture Ally? (Doesn't work right now)
TRIED: if decoys keep spawning (they don't)
TRIED: Look into knife options (throwable as stacks, throwable with ammo). Won't work as stacks, wepon no longer shows. Doesn't appear to work with ammo (to be tested further in A20).
FIX: Multiplayer placeable mechanical ally (might not be possible given the SpawnTrader respawn issue)
FIX: ally dog example in single player always spawns at same spot if using stacks
TESTED: POI resets do not affect trader entities

Main:
//Added Spawnable Mechanical Allies in Multiplayer (based on Decoy mechanic), now purchasable from Player vending machines at trader POIs
//Adjusted toolbelt notification when deploying mechanical allies in multiplayer to ensure players stay clear of the area they deploy them in to not affect the deployment process (could result in nothing happening)
//Added ability to stack Mechanical Pets up to 25 in multiplayer.
Adjustments to sight/sound detection
Added MaxViewAngle to UMATemplate
Update Navobject color for traders (Famer and Handyman)
Removed DF quest references
Adjusted Tier 1/2 Hazmat debuf range
Fixed tier 1 hazmat debuff
Added Radiation poisoning from Toxic Entities
Added recipe for Prussian Blue powder (iron, coal, coffee ground, nitrate - chemistry station)
Added recipe for Prussian Blue Remedy (campfire)

Items and Blocks:
Added custom debuff resistances for God mode
Adjusted knockdown on Stormbreaker throw
Increased boom stick chance for extra damage to 25% (from 10)
decreased area of effect for being affected by burning/shocked entities
Updated boom stick visual effect
Added special items to black shield titans loot (requires updated main mod)
