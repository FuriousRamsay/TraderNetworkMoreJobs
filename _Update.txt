Main:
//Added Spawnable Mechanical Allies in Multiplayer (based on Decoy mechanic), now purchasable from Player vending machines at trader POIs
//Adjusted toolbelt notification when deploying mechanical allies in multiplayer to ensure players stay clear of the area they deploy them in to not affect the deployment process (could result in nothing happening)
//Added ability to stack Mechanical Pets up to 25 in multiplayer.
