TODO: mod to replace POI groups (by tier?)

Once all new entities are done:
TODO: Modify screamer groups with entities (no UMA)

TODO: Farming Trader quests
TODO: Handyman Trader quests

TRIED: buffs cannot be given as a reward. IF so then set variables to prevent Faction War from being started if one is already underway.
TRIED: Mechanical Vulture Ally? (Doesn't work right now)
TRIED: if decoys keep spawning (they don't)
TRIED: Look into knife options (throwable as stacks, throwable with ammo). Won't work as stacks, wepon no longer shows. Doesn't appear to work with ammo (to be tested further in A20).
FIX: Multiplayer placeable mechanical ally (might not be possible given the SpawnTrader respawn issue)
FIX: ally dog example in single player always spawns at same spot if using stacks
TESTED: POI resets do not affect trader entities

Main:
//Added Spawnable Mechanical Allies in Multiplayer (based on Decoy mechanic), now purchasable from Player vending machines at trader POIs
//Adjusted toolbelt notification when deploying mechanical allies in multiplayer to ensure players stay clear of the area they deploy them in to not affect the deployment process (could result in nothing happening)
//Added ability to stack Mechanical Pets up to 25 in multiplayer.
Added Skulls
